# Color Clock 

I started this project to study Redux / Flux data flow. I needed to brush up on dispatching actions and reducer functions, and thought this simple page would be a good start. 

## Features 

The background color gradually changes every second. 

## Future Features 

[] Grab user's time and display corresponding color (involves math) 
[] Have a loading screen while grabbing time 

## Miscellaneous
